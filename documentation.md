### Infrastructure Definition

```plaintext
1. User Service
   - Endpoint: /register
   - Database: users
   - RabbitMQ: Publishes to subscription_user_registration_queue and payment_user_registration_queue

2. Payment Service
   - Endpoint: /make-payment
   - Database: payment.users, payments
   - RabbitMQ:
     - Consumes from payment_queue
     - Publishes to notification_queue

3. Notification Service
   - RabbitMQ: Consumes from notification_queue
   - External: Email Service

4. Subscription Service
   - RabbitMQ:
     - Publishes to payment_queue
     - Publishes to notification_queue

5. RabbitMQ
   - Queue: subscription_user_registration_queue
   - Queue: payment_user_registration_queue
   - Queue: payment_queue
   - Queue: notification_queue

6. Databases
   - User Service Database: users
   - Payment Service Database: payment.users, payments
```

### System Design Definition

**System Overview**:  
A subscription management platform enabling users to extend EMI payment dates by paying a minimal charge. The platform is built using a microservices architecture that facilitates independent operation, resilience, and scalability.

**Microservices**:

1. **Userservice**
    - **Responsibilities**: Manages user registration and profile updates.
    - **Database**: MongoDB (`users` collection).
    - **Communication**: Publishes user data to both `subscription_user_registration_queue` and `payment_user_registration_queue`.

2. **Paymentservice**
    - **Responsibilities**: Manages payment processing, including EMI extensions.
    - **Database**: MongoDB (`payments` and `payment.users` collections).
    - **Communication**:
        - Consumes from `payment_queue`.
        - Publishes notifications directly to `notification_queue`.

3. **Notificationservice**
    - **Responsibilities**: Sends notifications, such as payment confirmations and reminders.
    - **Database**: None (stateless).
    - **Communication**: Consumes from `notification_queue` and interfaces with an external email service.

4. **Subscriptionservice**
    - **Responsibilities**: Manages all subscription-related operations, including renewal processing.
    - **Communication**:
        - Publishes payment data to `payment_queue`.
        - Publishes notification data to `notification_queue`.

**Data Flow**:
1. **User Registration**:
    - User registers via `userservice`.
    - `userservice` creates a user entry in the `users` database.
    - `userservice` publishes user data to both `subscription_user_registration_queue` and `payment_user_registration_queue`.

2. **Payment Processing**:
    - User initiates a payment via `paymentservice`.
    - `paymentservice` processes the payment, storing details in `payments`.
    - `paymentservice` retrieves user details from `payment.users`.
    - `paymentservice` publishes a notification to `notification_queue`.

3. **Subscription Management**:
    - Subscription events trigger `subscriptionservice`.
    - `subscriptionservice` manages subscriptions and related EMI extensions.
    - Relevant data is published to `payment_queue` and `notification_queue`.

4. **Notification Dispatch**:
    - `notificationservice` consumes messages from `notification_queue`.
    - Sends emails through an external service to users about their payment status or reminders.

This documentation outlines a streamlined flow, ensuring each service is designed to operate independently while communicating effectively through designated RabbitMQ queues. This architecture promotes robustness, scalability, and responsiveness within the subscription management platform.
